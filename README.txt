bail or jail custom character loader by craftersshaft

this one is way worse than the skin loader but its easier for streamers to set up without a million years of playtime

bugs:
-animations are hardcoded to fbx
-i have not tested this ingame so it might break some stuff
-no way to customize lanterns/passive effects yet
-no checking for if other people have the mod
-no id overlap checking/fixing

documentation will be added later i dunno man i spent 9 days on this monstrosity and my code is held together with duct tape
most asset paths in the json are just the direct path to the asset, minus the extension and in all lowercase

also requires newtonsoft.json to be in bepinex/core
